# Architecture Dinner Project

The underlying goal of Architecture Dinner is to explore different ways of solving common problems with a set of people outside your company bubble. In an effort to very directly discuss consequences of architectural decisions, we will be experiencing design tradeoffs through writing code

Specifically we will be building a very simple app over the course of the next several months. Each month we will tackle a very specific aspect (testing, tool chains, db drivers, logging) and everyone is going to build a little bit. Each person will build in different languages and libraries and we will continually swap which repo each person is working in each month

The amount youâ€™ll need to build each month should be accomplishable in a day, so find a Saturday sometime in the month and knock it out. The "spec" for each month is captured in a doc in this repository.
